# multifractal-asset-model
A multifractal model of asset returns, inspired by the 1997 paper by Mandelbrot, Fisher, Calvet and Mandelbrot's book "The Misbehavior of Markets".

I have found this model very challenging to understand and implement from the texts available, hopefully this code helps others that are similarily inclined.

Code was written with https://github.com/Deckstar/Multifractal-Model-of-Asset-Returns-MMAR-for-Thesis as a closely studied reference to keep parity with output.
