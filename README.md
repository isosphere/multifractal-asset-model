# multifractal-asset-model
A multifractal model of asset returns, inspired by the 1997 paper by Mandelbrot, Fisher, Calvet and Mandelbrot's book "The Misbehavior of Markets".

I have found this model very challenging to understand and implement from the texts available, hopefully this code helps others that are similarily inclined.

Currently requires my own fork of the czt package due to an incompatibility with current rust versions, see this PR: https://github.com/stainless-steel/czt/pull/1.

Code was written with https://github.com/Deckstar/Multifractal-Model-of-Asset-Returns-MMAR-for-Thesis as a closely studied reference to keep parity with output.
